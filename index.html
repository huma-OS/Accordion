        <img src="./img/2pac.jpg" alt="Tupac Shakur" class="mc-image" />
        <p class="paragraph">
          (born Lesane Parish Crooks, 1971–1996), also known as 2Pac and Makaveli, was an iconic American rapper, actor,
          and activist, widely considered one of the most influential and impactful artists in music history. Known for
          addressing racial injustice, poverty, and social struggle, he rose to fame with 2Pacalypse Now (1991) and
          continued with Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and the introspective Me Against the World (1995), earning
          both critical and commercial acclaim.<br /><br />
          His 1996 double album All Eyez on Me marked a shift to gangsta rap and became a defining West Coast release,
          featuring hits like “California Love” and “Ambitionz az a Ridah.” That same year, he released The Don
          Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory as Makaveli shortly after his death. Posthumous releases such as R U Still Down?
          (1997), Until the End of Time (2001), and Loyal to the Game (2004) cemented his legacy, all achieving
          multi-platinum status. His collaborative work includes Thug Life: Volume I (1994) and Still I Rise (1999) with
          Outlawz.<br /><br />
          Tupac also starred in films like Juice, Poetic Justice, and Gridlock’d, and is remembered for songs like
          “Changes,” “Dear Mama,” and “Hit ’Em Up.” After surviving a shooting in 1994 and serving time in prison, he
          joined Death Row Records and became entangled in the East Coast–West Coast rivalry. He was fatally shot in a
          1996 drive-by, and his murder remains unsolved.<br /><br />
          With over 75 million records sold and a Diamond-certified Greatest Hits (1998) compilation, Tupac has been
          inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and honored with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star. His life, art,
          and activism continue to inspire global audiences and academic study.
