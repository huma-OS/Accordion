## Getting Started Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Open in Code Editor

We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **Live Server** extension installed.

### 3. Start the Live Server

Right-click on `index.html` and select:

```
Open with Live Server
```

Your browser will open the project automatically.

## Running Tests

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install Jest and required DOM environment for testing:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 2. Add Test Script

Make sure your `package.json` includes the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

### 3. Run the Tests

## Notes

* This project uses **CommonJS** for test compatibility (`module.exports` / `require`).
* Tests run in a simulated DOM using **jsdom**, not a real browser.
* Ensure your Node.js version supports ES6+ features (Node v14+ recommended).
